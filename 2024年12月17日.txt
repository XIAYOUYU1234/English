domain
In active mode, the ADC digitizes the charge signals from transducer, and digital signal processor conditions these signals in digital domain, processes the interrupts, and send data to Data registers (0x01~0x06) and FIFO (accessible through register 0x3F). 

while
In standby mode, most of the blocks are off, while device is ready for access through I2C.
